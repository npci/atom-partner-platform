"""HMAC envelope for A2A messages — sign + verify + replay protection.

Slice 5 of the A2A security hardening. Distinct from the Bearer JWT
(Slice 2/3): the JWT proves WHO is calling; the HMAC envelope proves
WHAT was sent (non-repudiation) and that it has not been replayed
(timestamp window + nonce uniqueness via redis).

Wire shape — three additional headers on every JSON-RPC request:

    X-NPCI-Timestamp   integer Unix seconds (UTC)
    X-NPCI-Nonce       32-char lowercase hex (16 random bytes)
    X-NPCI-Signature   lowercase hex of
                       HMAC-SHA256(secret, f"{ts}.{nonce}.{sha256_hex(body)}")

Both sides hash the raw HTTP request body bytes — no canonicalisation
needed because both sides see the same bytes on the wire (the SDK's
JSON-RPC envelope is already deterministic enough; we don't reorder
keys).

Receiver verification logic in `verify()`:
    1. Headers present and parsable                      → invalid_envelope
    2. |now - ts| <= MAX_SKEW_S                          → timestamp_skew
    3. Nonce unseen in redis (SETNX with TTL = NONCE_TTL_S)
                                                          → replay_detected
    4. constant-time-equal recomputed signature          → signature_mismatch

If `redis_client` is None (caller couldn't reach redis), step 3 is
skipped. If redis raises during the SETNX, the request is ALWAYS
REJECTED (fail-closed) — there is no env-var escape hatch. A previous
`HMAC_FAIL_OPEN` toggle allowed skipping the nonce check on a Redis
failure; it was removed because it silently reduced replay protection
to the timestamp-skew window alone, which is not acceptable for a
security control that can be flipped by an unreviewed environment
variable.

Both sides ship this same file. NPCI:
    backend/app/a2a_common/hmac_signer.py
Partner mirror:
    backend/app/a2a_common/hmac_signer.py in the atom-partner-platform
    repository. It is outside this repo's sync + hygiene gate, so a change
    here must be landed there in the same release or signatures stop matching
    across the trust boundary.
