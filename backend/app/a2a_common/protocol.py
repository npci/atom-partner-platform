"""A2A wire protocol v1 — the single source of truth for the message contract.

Implements `A2A_PROTOCOL_DESIGN.pdf` (v1.0): 28 typed messages + `echo`, one
common envelope, 22 structured error codes, and per-message metadata
(direction / lifecycle phase / correlation key). The PDF is *descriptive*; this
module is *authoritative* — the drift test (`tests/a2a_common/test_protocol_contract.py`)
asserts the frozen 28 here match the PDF appendix exactly.

MIRROR: this file is byte-identical with the partner platform's copy at
`backend/app/a2a_common/protocol.py` in the atom-partner-platform repository,
which is not covered by this repo's sync + hygiene gate. Change one, change
both, and land the two in the same release.

Deltas from the frozen PDF (see `docs/A2A_PROTOCOL_MIGRATION.md` for rationale):
  1. envelope carries `protocol_version`
  2. envelope carries `message_id` — the uniform dedup/idempotency key
  3. `echo` uses the full envelope like every other message
  4. `change_id` lives in the envelope only (not duplicated into payloads)

Phase 0 establishes the enum, error codes, envelope, and per-message metadata.
Concrete per-message payload models are filled in as each message-group phase
lands (Phases 2–4); until then a payload validates against the permissive
`PayloadBase` (extra fields allowed, matching the "preserve extensions" decision).

Pure module: stdlib + pydantic only. No SDK, no app models, no DB — so it
imports cleanly in both the NPCI app graph and the partner SQLite harness.

      * **Missing fields stay tolerated.** Rejecting an envelope that omits
        `message_id`/`correlation_id`/`protocol_version` would break a legacy
        or older-version NPCI that never sends them. That compatibility
        promise is why this reader exists, and it is unchanged.

      * **Wrong-typed fields are no longer passed through.** Previously
        `payload` was `data.get("payload") or {}`, so a JSON body sending
        `"payload": "some string"` handed a `str` to every downstream handler
        that is annotated `dict` and calls `.get()` on it — an AttributeError
        deep inside a handler at best, and at worst a value used in a context
        that accepts both. `change_id` typed as a dict flowed into DB lookups.
        A field of the wrong type is now read as absent, so the existing
        `if not task_type` / `if not payload` guards catch it at the boundary
        where the error is legible.

    This closes the actual exploitable half of the gap (type confusion from an
    H3 boundary) at zero compatibility cost. Full strict rejection of unknown
    or missing fields remains a protocol-version decision to make jointly with
    NPCI, not something to impose unilaterally from the partner side.
